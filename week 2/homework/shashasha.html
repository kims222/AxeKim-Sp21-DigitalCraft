		<h2>Delivering Japanese and Asian Photography to the World</h2>
		<p>shashasha was started in 2013 with the aim of delivering Asian photography to a worldwide audience. With a selection of over 1200 titles, including artist prints and vintage photobooks, shashasha’s diverse artist line-up ranges from rare titles by photography icons such as Nobuyoshi Araki, Daido Moriyama, Kazuo Kitai, Keizo Kitajima and Takashi Hamaguchi to works by vibrant newcomers. In Fall 2016, we began to widen our selection to include publications by selected photobook publishers from all over the world. </p>


		<h2>shashasha’s aims</h2>
		<p>The distribution of photobooks is extremely limited, and it is nigh impossible for an independent publisher to enter the national and global distribution systems. Artists want their work to be seen by the largest possible audience and publishers would like to give people a chance to buy their books. We conceived shashasha as a way of making our books accessible to anyone, anywhere in the world.</p>
